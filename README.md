# House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

A complete machine learning solution for predicting house prices using Linear Regression. This project implements a full data science pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

# 🏠 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, population density, and median income. It demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow including data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# 📊 Dataset

The project uses the California Housing Dataset which contains:

· 20,640 samples of housing districts
· 8 numerical features + 1 categorical feature
· Target variable: median_house_value

# Features:

· longitude, latitude: Geographic coordinates
· housing_median_age: Median age of houses
· total_rooms: Total number of rooms
· total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms
· population: Total population in block
· households: Total number of households
· median_income: Median income of households
· ocean_proximity: Proximity to ocean (categorical)

# 🚀 Features

· Complete Data Pipeline: Loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
· Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and statistical analysis
· Feature Engineering: Handling categorical variables, correlation analysis
· Model Training: Linear Regression implementation
· Model Evaluation: RMSE and R² score calculation
· Results Visualization: Actual vs Predicted plots, residual analysis
· Model Persistence: Save trained model using pickle

# 📈 Results

The trained Linear Regression model achieves:

· RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): ~$68,000
· R² Score: ~0.65
· Interpretable coefficients showing feature importance

Spam Detection - Machine Learning Project

A complete machine learning solution for detecting spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project implements an end-to-end pipeline from text preprocessing to model deployment with an interactive CLI interface.

📧 Project Overview

This project classifies SMS messages as either "Spam" (unwanted/unsolicited messages) or "Ham" (legitimate messages). It demonstrates comprehensive NLP workflow including text preprocessing, feature extraction, model comparison, evaluation, and deployment.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the SMS Spam Collection Dataset which contains:

· 5,572 SMS messages
· 2 classes: Ham (legitimate) and Spam
· Class distribution:

· Ham messages: 4,827 (87%)
· Spam messages: 747 (13%)

Features:

· Message: Raw text content of SMS
· Label: 'ham' or 'spam' (target variable)
· Clean_Message: Preprocessed text after cleaning and stemming

🚀 Features

· Complete Text Pipeline: Cleaning, stemming, stopword removal
· Exploratory Data Analysis: Class distribution visualization
· Feature Engineering: TF-IDF Vectorization for text to numerical conversion
· Model Comparison: Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression
· Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
· Results Visualization: Side-by-side confusion matrix comparison
· Model Persistence: Save best pipeline using joblib
· Interactive CLI: Real-time spam detection interface

📈 Results

The trained models achieve:

· Naive Bayes Accuracy: 96.5%
· Logistic Regression Accuracy: 97.8%
· Precision (Spam): 0.99
· Recall (Spam): 0.92
· F1-Score: 0.95
